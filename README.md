# Loyola University Degree Planner
CS496 Senior Project <br/>
By: Chelsea Meier and Rye Verille

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the Loyola University Degree Planner is to produce a website that will allow students and advisors to easily create and view a college degree plan for all Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics majors. This product will allow users to view different major and minor combinations in an organized manner to visually see what their four years at Loyola University Maryland will look like.

## Implemented Features
In this current version, the first screen of the website has been created. There is a drop-down menu that lists all of the degree/major/minor combinations that the website will support. In addition, there is a 'Next' button that the user can click after they select a degree/major/minor combination that will take them to the following screen. The second screen contains required course column that populates with all of the required courses needed to complete the degree chosen on the first screen. Additionally, there is a table layout that incudes twelve boxes, 8 semester boxes and 4 summer boxes. The users are able to drag and drop the courses in the required course column into any of the boxes within the table layout. There is a navigation bar at the top of the screen that holds three buttons. A user manual button that can be clicked to display instructions on how to use the website. There is also a 'Print' button to print out a copy of the created degree plan, as well as a 'Back' button that can be used to take the user back to the first screen.

## Not Yet Implemented Features
In this current version, most of the features have been implemented. The features that were not able to be completed by the deadline include the constraints needed for the twelve boxes. These constraints include accounting for the possibility of prerequites as well as accounting for courses only offered in the fall or spring.

## Dependencies
The dependencies used in the project include the database found on studentvhost2 and Bootstrap. The database stores all of the data that supports the possible degree combinations and their required courses. Bootstrap is framework imported into the code in order to help build and style the features of the website. Bootstrap is used soley for the development of the website and therefore there is no required installation for the user in order to have it work with the website.

## Instructions for Compilation
