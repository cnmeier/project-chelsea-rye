# Loyola University Degree Planner
CS496 Senior Project <br/>
By: Chelsea Meier and Rye Verille

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the Loyola University Degree Planner is to produce a website that will allow students and advisors to easily create and view a college degree plan for all Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics majors. This product will allow users to view different major and minor combinations in an organized manner to visually see what their four years at Loyola University Maryland will look like.

## Implemented Features
In this current version, the first screen of the website has been created. There is currently a drop-down menu that lists all of the degree/major/minor combinations that the website will support. In addition, there is a 'Next' button that the user can click after they select a degree/major/minor combination that will take them to the following screen. Currently, the second screen contains the layoutour the screen but features are not yet implemented there.

## Not Yet Implemented Features
In this current version, the features on the second screen are not yet implemented. Those features include a list of required courses based on the degree/major/minor combination that the user chose on the first screen, the drag and drop feature into each of the 12 sections, the constraints having to do with the drag and drop feature, and the download into a pdf feature.
